3dCube
======

3dcube in CSS3 and Javascript.

===========================================================================

This is a Cube that can be rotated using the mouse and has a snap feature for now. 
The rotation is about the X,Y axes. Need to perfect it for the z-axis as well. Better rotation Algorithms
